# About Me

Hello, I'm **Ritam Sarkar**, a computer science student and developer from India. I build fast, practical web applications and enjoy turning ideas into complete, real-world solutions.

I'm also passionate about Linux and self-hosting. I run my own NixOS-based home server where I manage websites and services, gaining hands-on experience with system architecture, networking, and infrastructure.

I focus on creating clean, reliable, and performance-oriented projects while continuously improving my skills and exploring new technologies.
